# Bingo Machine

## Playing

To start a new game, load up a fresh page or click the "Reset" button.

Called numbers will be highlighted in the grid.

To call a new number, click the "Call" button.

The newest called number will be displayed under "Number Selected"

The total count of called numbers will be displayed under "Total Called"

If you are playing on a large screen, the newest called number will also display on the right.
This allows you to stretch the page evenly across 2 monitors, so that the left monitor is
the bingo admin board, and the right monitor shows only the last called number,
for the benefit of the players.
